    "# Semantic Analysis Of Amazon Electronic Review\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project for CSCI760 Computer Linguistics course for Spring 2018 semester, I will be processing a set of courpus and building a ML model that will help me determine a particular document's semantical meaning. I will be processing a dataset that I found online, a corpus of Amazon reviews on electronics. I will be running them through various NLP libraries to find the tf-idf scores of each document in a vectorized space, and will be calculating their pairwise cosine similarities to determine how each document is related to the other documents in the corpus. I will also try and visualize these documents in a 2/3 dimensional euclidean space, and also run these data points through various clustering algorithms to help better visualize their semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will be using the following programming languages/libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3: https://docs.python.org/3/\n",
    "NLTK: https://www.nltk.org/\n",
    "gensim: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\n",
    "scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n",
    "matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up this project, please reference the README that is commited to this git repository as part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in my project was to find a sufficient dataset that I can use to start building my model from. For my project on semantic analysis, I had decided to use a set of Amazon review articles on electronics that I found at the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit goes to Julian McAuley, UCSD for providing a collection of 1000K+ amazon reviews on electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning/Formatting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the data, I noticed it was structured in JSON format, along with other fields that were not really useful for my project (i.e reviewerName, asin product code, unixReviewTime, etc...). In order to extract the field that I was interested in (reviewText), I had decided to convert them into CSV format and store them in an array for easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindesight, I could've probably used a JSON parser to run through them, but an unintended side effect was that I realized there were some entries which were not formatted properly and/or missing reviewText fields. Below is the python script that I used to parse my data and output a `testdata.csv` file which I will be using to build my model."

    "## Creating stoplist\n",
    "\n",
    "A stoplist is a list of words that we generally do not care about. Preposition words such as \"like\", \"through\", \"at\" and other words that generate unnecessary noise in our dataset are considered stoplist words. These words will need to be removed from our corpus. Fortunately, the Python nltk library readily provides for us a list of stop words that we can use by simply providing a language type parameter (in our case english), and it will return a set of stoplist words.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Remove stop words\n",
    "# Load stop words to reduce noise\n",
    "stoplist = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "stoplist.update(['-', 'yet', 'yea', 'zs15'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list will be passed along into the `TfidfVectorizer` function (part of sklearn library) as parameters to reduce the noice generated by these unnecessary words when calculating the tf-idf score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating the tf-idf score\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the tf-idf score, we will use the scikitlearn library. This library will generate a tf-idf score, based upon a corpus input parameter, along with optional stoplist parameters that will remove all the unnecessary stoplist words for you automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, it's important to understand what the tf-idf score is. Tf-idf stands for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. It's basically the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf(term): (frequency of a given term in a document) / (normalized over the total number of terms in the document)\n",
    "i.e:\n",
    "Given a sentence: \"This project is a very hard project\"\n",
    "Tf(project) = 2/7 = 0.285714\n",
    "\n",
    "Idf(term): log((Total number of document) / (number of document containing the term))\n",
    "i.e:\n",
    "Given these two sentences:\n",
    "A - \"This project is a very hard project\"\n",
    "B - \"I like this project\"\n",
    "Idf(project) = log(2/2) = log(1) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-idf is simply then: Tf * Idf\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/tfidf_eq.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This score is useful as it will tell us the frequency of a particular term in the document, with respect to the number of frequencey across the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note* a logrithmic function is applied to the Idf calculation. This is purely for weighing up/down the result as the size of the dataset (and thus the frequency of the term) grows. This is not as noticable in our example as it only contains two documents/sentences, as opposed to a corpus of millions of lines/documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the TfIdf score, we will use the library scikitlearn, which readly provides us a function that will give us the vectorized tf-idf score per document. We simply need to provide the corpus and an optional parameter of stoplist:\n",

    "Now that we have a the tf-idf score of the document in a vectorized space, we can calculate the angle between any two document to determine how close they are to each other. Recall that cos(theta) ranges from -1 to 1, and that cos(0) = 1. Thus when we compare the cosine of the difference in their angles, the closer the result is to 1, the closer in similarities their tf-idf score. To get the pairwise cosine similarity of a document to all the other documents in our corpus, scikit-learn readily provides for us the cosine_similarity function, into which we will pass two parameters. The first being the vectorized tf-idf score of the document that we would like to compare, and the second being the entire collection of tf-idf score for all the documents in the corpus for us to compare with:\n",

    "\n",
    "Our vector `V` with its rich data filled tf-idf scored/cosine similarity score, it was time for me to start visualizing these datapoints to see how they are similar to one another. As human beings, living in a 3 dimensional space, it's near impossible for us to visualize a 1000+ dimensional vector space, thus a dimensional reduction algorithm is needed to reduce the ~1000+ vector elements in `V` into 2/3 dimensional vectors that we can then plot and visualize. There are many dimensional reduction algorithms, but I had ultimately settled on the T-SNE algorithm, which emphasized on keeping the relative distance between data points, while reducing their vectors/features into 2/3 dimensions. This algorithm was invented by Laurens van der Maaten, a ML research scientist currently working at facebook, and Geoffry Hinton. Below is a link to Laurens van der Maaten's paper from '08, along with an excerpt.\n",

    "T-SNE uses machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability of each point being in a similar cluster with the next. It finds this similarity score based on a normal Gausian distribution. After these scores are obtained, it then projects the plots onto a lower order dimension in a random mannar and try to re-adjust itself to match the distribution scores that we obtaine from above:\n",

I will have to cut the metal plate to get to the P.C connector if i choose to connect a computer.Haven't decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate.Other than that, it's a great product and meets my need for a hanging television.\n",
